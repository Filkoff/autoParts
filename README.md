# AutoParts

## Server part

- For running this app you should use PostgreSQL.
- Create database called "people", where our users with personal data will be stored.
- Install all dependencies: $ `npm i`
- Run the server: $ `npm run start` (that will also automatically create table called Users in our database)
- $ `npm run build` for building the app for production to the `build` folder

## Client part

- Install all dependencies: $ `npm i`
- Run the client: $ `npm run start`
- For integration testing (Cypress) use: $ `npm run test`
